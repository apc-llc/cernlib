C- The machine flags have been removed from some routines to help
C    users who would like to implement the standard Fortran version.
C    Although they will compile they are not guaranteed to work
C    on the older systems (e.g. epdefu may not work on VM).
C    The common epvxun has been included everywhere for epdefu but
C    also may not be used in this version.

C                         standard Fortran version.
C-  P=EPIO  ,D=EPDEFU   : Remove machine flags.
C-  P=EPIO  ,D=EPINIT   : Return if epinit has already been called.
C                         Reset EPVXUN for EPDEFU
