*-- Author :    Alfred Nathaniel   29/04/93
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/09   930607 15.43
*
* KMDIAL: fix for Piaf password prompt in Motif.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/08   930604 13.55
*
* Deck KUPIAF removed.  Piaf syncronization moved into PAW.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/07   930527 13.11
*
* Linux version introduced.
*
* Restructuring of getline(): previous terminal interface recognition failed
* for NeXT.
*
* Motif window for menu guidance text.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/06   930526 15.19
*
* On Apollo the complete C part can and should be compiled under BSD now.
*
* SHELL command: fixed problem with VMS batch and Apollo /bin/sh.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/05   930525 18.24
*
* New routine KUPROP(CHPRMT,CHVAL,NCH) to prompt for a password.
*
* STYLE GP: panel lines can be redefined with fewer numbers of fields.
*
* Piaf synchronization for VMS/Multinet implemented.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/04   930511 15.22
*
* Bug fix in ICONBOX.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/03   930511 15.10
*
* The routine registered by KUCOMV is now called without arguments.  The called
* routine has to CALL KUVNAM(VNAME) to retrieve the vector name which was
* deleted.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/02   930507 10.30
*
* KUCOMV routine was only called for '*' (delete all vectors).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/01   930504 11.49
*
* New routine KUCOMV(SUB) to register a subroutine SUB(CHNAME) which is called
* whenever a vector is deleted.  This is mainly needed for COMIS which keeps a
* table of defined vectors.
*
* New system function $FORMAT(number,format) to format a number according to a
* Fortran-like FORMAT string, e.g. $FORMAT([x],F9.3). Supports F,E,G,I, and
* Z (hexadecimal).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/00   930429 17.48
*
* KIDTAB: replace TABs by an equivalent number of blanks (assuming tab
* positions are every 8th column).  Before TABS were replaced by a single
* blank only.
*
* STYLE G could not be used in PAWLOGON.
*
* Add minus sign to list of valid characters for building alias names
* (request by Per Scharff-Hansen).
*
* KUGETE did not work when prompting for missing mandatory argument
* (reported by Steve Fisher).
*
* KIMINT: label calculation caused integer overflow when using more than
* 26 IF-ENDIF constructs (fatal on VMS).  Changing from MAXIFS=200,MAXIFN=20
* to MAXIFS=120,MAXIFN=10 should push the limit beyond 100.  Hopefully
* nobody uses more then 10 levels of nested IFs.
*
* KUARGS: mismatch between code and manual.  Option BATCH should NOT imply
* NOLOG, i.e. LOGON.KUMAC should still be executed.
