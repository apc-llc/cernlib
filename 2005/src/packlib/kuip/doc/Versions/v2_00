*CMZ :  2.00/16 15/02/93  17.08.42  by  Alfred Nathaniel
*-- Author :    Alfred Nathaniel   04/12/92
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/16   930215 17.08
*
* The location of the kxterm executable can now be defined as environment
* variable KXTERM.
*
* Access from C to PAWC through a pointer to allow the use of dynamic common
* blocks on IBM.
*
* Corrections for MVS (Harald Butenschoen).
*
* Ansi C compiler on Sun provides fixed include files <time.h> and <signal.h>.
*
* V/CREATE and V/INPUT allow again vector elements to be used as initializers
* (reported by L.Pontecorvo)
*
* The macro READ statement did not provide the correct default value for
* already existing variables (reported by Timothy Cox).
*
* The number of commands in the history list printed by "!" is now restricted
* to the value set by SET/RECORDING.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/15   930201 14.27
*
* SET/ROOT was looking at menus at the same level as the root menu.
* SET/ROOT now changes the prompt to the menu name.
* (Problems reported by Mogens Dam.)
*
* KUIP/EDIT creates new files in the first directory in the MACRO/DEFAULTS
* search list. Before it has always created in the current directory.
* (Problem reported by Nige Watson.)
*
* Another bug fix for string concatenation: "abc//'def'//ghi" gave the
* wrong result. (Problem reported by Nicole Lhermitte.)
*
* KUGETL: blank values in a variable length argument list were ignored.
*
* Remove edit server lock file before exiting.
*
* Avoid "writable strings" problem with default values.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/14   930128 18.32
*
* Alpha/VMS CC with /STAN=VAXC is now compiling without warnings.
*
* Second iteration for NeXT implementation.
*
* Bug fix in getline(): memory was overwritten when prompt exceeded
* 80 characters (affected PAWGKS on VMS).
*
* After 3 consecutive ^C ask whether he wants to exit from application.
*
* Put additional calls to KUALFA in strategic places.
*
* "READ var" keeps the initial value of macro variable when pressing <CR>.
* Problem reported by Tim Cox.
*
* For implicit LOOP arguments to commands: comma is only recognized as
* argument separator if it is outside balanced ().
*
* For KUGETL: comma is only recognized as argument separator if it is
* outside balanced () or ''.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/13   930126 16.50
*
* Avoid compiler warnings on Apollo and SGI.
*
* Fix for accessing common blocks from C on Cray.
*
* Restored old behaviour for KUPROx routines: input value is left unchanged
* if typing <CR>.
*
* Fix for SUN and DECstation: strtod() is declared in <math.h> instead
* of <stdlib.h>
*
* Replace long by int: we assume that int is at least 32 bits.
*
* New routine KUGRFL to flush the graphics output after each command.
* The routine passed should do the same as IGTERM for X11 but be dummy for GKS.
*
* KUGETE ignored default value.
*
* First iteration for NeXT implementation.
*
* KIMULT: '*' was missing from list of characters which inhibit ';' being
* the line separator --> on VMS "shell del file.type;*" was not working
* inside a macro.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/12   930122 21.24
*
* Removed KUALFA after each command executed.
*
* On VM/CMS: replace sleep() emulation by call to SLEEPF (clash with with
* entry in COMMTXT.TXTLIB).
*
* On VAX/VMS: MACRO/DEFAULT -Auto worked only if a search path was set.
*
* Undefined numbered variables, e.g. [1] are now replaced by "!".
*
* KUGETI and KUGETR now prompt in case the argument is not a valid number.
*
* Wrong logic in string concatenation: "abc//def//'ghi'" became "'abc//defghi'"
* instead of "'abcdefghi'".
*
* "TRACE ON TEST" executed action routines.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/11   930121 16.27
*
* "V/CREATE name" is now treated as "V/CREATE name(1)".
*
* Environment variable KUIPEDITOR takes precedence over EDITOR.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/10   930120 18.43
*
* New CDF features are now available as well through Fortran mode of KUIPC.
*
* "-option" was only recognized if it was the last argument on the command
* line.
*
* Use G-format instead of F-format to convert result of $SIGMA.
*
* Edit server is only used if HOST_EDITOR command contains a '&'.
* HOST_EDITOR 'vi &' is treated as HOST_EDITOR 'xterm -e vi &'.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/09   930118 16.45
*
* Style GP reimplemented.
*
* Motif terminal kxterm introduced.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/08   930115 14.06
*
* FATMEN's "LS file -L" did not work because the second parameter is an
* Integer which had implictly the MINUS flag set inhibiting the CHOPT trial.
* ==> KUIPC changed that the MINUS flag for numeric parameters is not set
* automatically any more. Instead "-value" on a numeric argument position
* is checked whether it is a number. Otherwise the CHOPT assignment is tried.
*
* The filename "last.kumac" was undefined when exiting with having executed
* a LAST command (message "Cannot open" when leaving application).
*
* In order to allow the new HPLOT escape sequences "@[" an undocumented
* feature had to be removed: The construct "@[name]" forced variable
* substitution even inside quoted strings. The same functionality is
* achieved by using "//" for string concatenation, e.g. "vecname='vec@[n]'"
* has to be replaced by "vecname='vec'//[n]".
*
* Bug fix for VMS file paths inside macros, e.g. "shell dir disk$xx:[user]".
* Note: VMS file paths may NOT appear in EXEC statements inside a macro,
* i.e. "EXEC DISK$xx:[user]macnam" does not work inside a macro (it does
* though when entering it on the command line).
* Workaround: define a logical name for the directory path and use
* "EXEC LOG_NAME:macnam" or include the directory in the kumac search
* path "MACRO/DEFAULT [],DISK$xx:[user]" and use "EXEC macnam".
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/07   930113 15.58
*
* Typing "Q" after WAIT prompt terminates macro execution.
*
* Bug fix in Motif prompt for WAIT command.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/06   930112 18.45
*
* In concatenated system functions, e.g. "$machine$os" only the last one
* was replaced.
*
* Macro variables "[%var]" were not replaced.
*
* TRACE ON WAIT implemented.
*
* All keyboard input requests are now done through Motif widgets.
*
* KGETAR did not work for VMS.
*
* New special argument value "!!" replaced by value used for previous
* command execution, i.e. for mandatory parameters it behaves like
* pressing <CR> at prompt.
*
* "-option" syntax was misbehaving if a shorted range value was a substring
* of a longer range value.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/05   930107 17.38
*
* The dollar sign can be used in alias names.
*
* LaTeX manual formatting improved.
*
* Command LAST excluded the last command.
*
* Appending the default ".KUMAC" filetype was not done for VMS path names
* like "[dir.sub]file".
*
* Problems with macro variable substitition if macro file name contains a
* VMS directory path solved. (Special thanks to Rob Kreuger for reporting
* the VMS related problems.)
*
* MACRO/DEFAULT -Auto/AutoReverse reimplemented. The default path can now
* be a comma separated list of directories.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/04   921218 17.03
*
* Falco terminals lost arrow keys when logging into TAGIBM because the
* escape sequences changes from "ESC-[-A" to "ESC-O-A".
*
* VMS signal handler installed to avoid program aborting for VMS
* specific exceptions, e.g. invalid filenames.
*
* Unix only: KUHOME replaces now again environment variables in
* filenames, e.g. $HOME/file.type
*
* When prompting for missing arguments the last used value is proposed
* as default.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/03   921214 19.06
*
* KUIPAPPL.TMP files are opened for unformatted access to allow RECFM V
* on VM/CMS.
*
* Bug fix for VM/CMS crash in KUPATH: In a CALL SUB('ABC') to a C function
* SUB(char *ptr, int*len) the pointer ptr my NOT be considered as a local
* variable. Doing ptr++ will be disastrous in the end.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/02   921211 18.13
*
* KUIP system functions were not substituted if used in CASE
* e.g. CASE $OS IN ... did not work
*
* Bug fix for VM/CMS crash when calling help for command with
* >User-Help twice
*
* KUARGS for option -n (no logon kumac) fixed
*
* Assignments "name = val" evaluated to "name = @macname[val]".
* Fixed by removing the obsoleted feature of decoding unbracketed
* variable names on the right hand side, i.e. "i = i+1" must now
* be written as "i = [i]+1".
*
* KUVAR was passing a string constant to routines which could overwrite it.
*
* Name clash with FATMEN for routine fmatch(). Renamed to fwmatch()
*
* Command repetition now also recognized if ! is not in first column.
*
* Recognize alias names as help item, e.g. "A/CRE LS DIR C; HELP LS"
*
* Delete KUIPHELP.TMP file after exiting from HELP in -EDIT style
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/01   921209 17.54
*
* Delete temp vectors created for non-contiguous subarrays
*
* For gcc (Sun) use option -fwritable-strings
*
*::>          VERSION  2.00/00   921204 21.36
*
* A large fraction of KUIP has been rewritten in C. The new version is
* intended to be (mostly) backwards compatible to the old one but because
* of the large amount of new code involved we cannot exclude that some
* incompatibilities remain. We want to urge all users to test their KUMAC
* files with the PAW version in the new area before it goes into production.
*
* At the moment the following features are not yet fully implemented:
*
*    DEFAULTS -AUTO
*    MANUAL in SGML and plain TeX
*    STYLE GP
*    TRACE WAIT
*    system functions for STYLE GP ($KEYNUM, $KEYVAL)
*
*
* Known incompatibilities:
*
*  - Alias names may contain only letters, digits, @-signs and underscores.
*    (If someone can make a strong case that this is too restrictive,
*    let us know; we can still consider going back to the old scheme.)
*
*  - The commands /KUIP/LISTHELP and /KUIP/SET_SHOW/MODE have been removed.
*
*
* Improvements:
*
*  - There is no limit on the number of aliases anymore.
*    Since KUMAC variables are treated internally as a special kind of
*    alias complex macros could hit the limit of 200 aliases before.
*
*  - The HELP command recognizes now abbreviations for submenu names.
*    E.g. HELP H/OP works now while before HELP HISTOGRAM/OPERATIONS had
*    to be spelled out.
*
*  - The HELP command does a simple text formatting. The line length is
*    controlled by /KUIP/SET_SHOW/COLUMNS.
*
*  - The HELP -EDIT option is now implemented for all systems.
*    A new command /KUIP/SET_SHOW/HOST_PAGER defines the pager used to
*    display the help text.  E.g. on a Unix workstation define
*    HOST_PAGER 'xterm -e view &' to display the help text in a
*    separate window.
*
*  - A new command /KUIP/SET_SHOW/FILECASE allows now to select the case
*    sensitivity for filenames on Unix systems. Before this functionality
*    was hidden as STYLE '-FILECASE ON'.
*
*  - A new command /KUIP/SET_SHOW/RECALL_STYLE to define the command recall
*    and editing style.  There is a choice between ksh/emacs-like binding
*    and the key definitions used by DCL command line editing on VAX/VMS.
*
*******************************************************************************
*  - A completely new Motif interface with a browser for application          *
*    specific object types and many more features.                            *
