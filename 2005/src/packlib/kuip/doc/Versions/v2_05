*     etc...
* and panel 0 r p2
*     panel 3.04 'blue/panel2' 'blue'

* button (which was not meaningful) is suppressed.
*
* EXEC: on VM search all disks for .kumac files.
*
* KUSPY('OFF') now goes back to the argument position marked by KUSPY('ON')
* instead of simply rewinding to the very first argument.
*
* KUGETH deleted.  It was unsafe and could overwrite storage.
* Hopefully nobody uses it.
*
* KUGETQ deleted.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/08   27/06/94 15.07.11
*
* Fixed problem with blanks in CASE label list.

*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/07   16/06/94 14.39.41

*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/06   06/06/94 12.40.01
*
* $SHELL(cmd) and $SHELL(cmd,' ') now return the complete output with
* newlines replaced by blanks.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/05   06/06/94 11.55.32
*
* MACRO/DEFAULTS -auto did not work because of case mismatch.
* MACRO/DEFAULTS ~/dir did not work on some systems because default shell
* does not understand ~ (reported by Maarten Litmaath).
*
* Macros: use checksum instead of file modification date to test if
* .kumac file has changed.  File system stamp have a granularity of
* one second which could lead to problems.
*
* New system function $SHELL(cmd) and $SHELL(cmd,n) to return first or
* n'th line of command output (for Unix only).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/04   30/05/94 17.17.10
*
* Macros: variable indirection did not work.
*
* VAXC: go back to (much slower) standard malloc() routines.
* The VAXC$MALLOC_OPT routines have a serious flaw:
*   for( n = 1; n < 100000; n++ ) buf = realloc( buf, n );
* will exhaust the virtual address space?!?
*
* READ statement: show default value also if prompt is user supplied.
*
*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/03   26/05/94 09.41.07
*
* Fix for STOPM statement and ";&" logic in macros.
*
*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/02   24/05/94 16.31.33
*
* Rewrite of the KUMAC interpreter in C.  The main difference is that
* EXEC inside a macro is treated like any other command.  This solves
* a number of outstanding problems:
*
* -- "EXE", "M/EXEC", or any other abbreviation of the command path
*    "/MACRO/EXEC" is now allowed.  Before this would lead to undefined
*    behaviour due to a recursive Fortran call.
*
* -- Defining an alias for an EXEC call or changing the MACRO/DEFAULT
*    path during macro execution has now the expected effect.  Before
*    aliases and .kumac search where done at macro compilation time
*    rather than execution time.
*
* -- It is now possible to execute a macro containing EXEC calls to
*    non-existing .kumac files --- provided, of course, that the EXEC
*    is never reached, e.g. in a "CASE $OS IN ..." construct.
*
* -- It is now possible to create or to modify a .kumac file during
*    macro execution and call the macros in the new file.
*
* -- Mixed-case path names of .kumac files are possible now.
*
* The response time should be better than in the previous version:
*
* -- The new compiler needs only one pass rather than two passes over
*    the .kumac file.
*
* -- A macro calling other macros will compiler the other .kumac files
*    when needed rather than compiling everything up-front.
*
* -- Macros are cached --- if a .kumac file has been envoked already
*    beforehand and it hasn't been changed then it is not recompiled
*    when it is used again.
*
* In addition the following bugs are fixed in the new version:
*
* -- ON ERROR GOTO works now also for nested EXEC calls.
*
* -- Undefined numbered variables are now set to ' ' as documented.
*
* -- Depending on the length of the .kumac file name the use of several
*    variables in an expression could lead to truncation due to the
*    fixed length of a Fortran character string.
*
* The new version provides the following new features:
*
* -- The READ statement allows to specify the prompt string.
*
* -- The NEXTL statement allows to continue with the next loop iteration,
*    similar to the "continue" statement in C.
*
* -- BREAKL and NEXTL allow to specify how many levels of nested loops
*    should be skipped.
*
* -- The STOPM statement allows to stop macro execution, i.e. unwind
*    nested EXEC calls and return to the command line prompt immediately.
*
* -- The RETURN statement allows to specify the return value.
*
* -- The variable "[0]" contains the fully qualified macro name, i.e.
*    "/path/file.kumac#macro".
*
* -- ON ERROR handling allows now the following choices:
*      ON ERROR CONTINUE
*      ON ERROR GOTO label
*      ON ERROR EXITM value
*      ON ERROR STOPM
*
* -- The spelling "OFF ERROR" instead of "OF ERROR" is now allowed.
*
* -- Block constructs can now be written on a single line using ";"
*    as line separator, e.g. "cmd1 ; IF ... THEN ; cmd2 ; ENDIF".
*
* -- The macro constructs are now documented in the on-line help ---
*    try "HELP SYNTAX".  Thanks to Mike Kelsey for editing the text.
*
* -- "!" as macro argument will now use the default value given in
*    the MACRO definition.
*
* The new version contains the following known incompatibilities:
*
* -- The command /MACRO/RECURSION has been deleted --- all macros are
*    recursive now.
*
* -- ":=" as alternative to the assignment operator "=" is not supported
*    anymore.  NB: "LET var = expr" is still allowed.
*
* Special thanks to Robert Franchisseur, Mike Kelsey, and Andrea Parri
* for beta-testing the new macro interpreter.
*
* --------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Correction for char '~' (to be recognized as the home directory
* in browser (decks KMBFIL, KMBMAC).
*
* Correction for expanding correctly the Path with / when ~ is the first
* character (deck KMBROW).
*
* Correction for correctly execute "delete file" menu item in the
* browser (KUIP/SHELL rm filename, deck MKDCMP)
*
* getline(): ^Z did not work on SunOS and other BSD based systems because
* there getpgrp() needs pid as argument (in contrast to SysV and Posix)
* (reported by Maarten Ballintijn).
*
* SHELL command: on Unix interpret command line by HOST_SHELL shell.
* Before the command was passed to whatever shell was spawned by system().
*
* KUCMD would still create menus with identical names (reported by Sunanda
* Banerjee).
*
* New system functions $FEXIST(filename).
*
* New command SET/DOLLAR to enable/disable the substitution of "$var" as
* environment variables.
*
* New system function $ENV(var) to get environment variable independent of
* DOLLAR setting.
*
*
*::>          VERSION  2.05/01   07/04/94 08.56.31
*
- Correction for compilation on VM
- Bug correction in the browser on Sun (popup menus)
- Give access to specific resources in the browser
  (e.g. fileScWindow.bottomOffset, etc...) for adjusting the browser
  "inside geometry" when using very big fonts (for the Geant demo
  at CHEP ...)
*::>          VERSION  2.05/00   25/03/94 16.34.38
*
- Complete redesign of the "Panel" interface :
  *  menu-bar with "File", "View" and "Help" (instead of buttons "Save",
     "Close" and "Help" at the bottom).
  *  possibility to have key with labels (aliases), commands or pixmaps.
     The general command for key definition is:
       "panel x.y command [label] [pixmap]"
  * In "View" menu, possibility to view:
    -> By Name
    -> By Icon
    -> By Name and Icon (not yet implemented).
    -> By Command (normal)
    -> By Command (1 col.)
  * Implement "context help" on all panel buttons (user defined).
  * Command "Panel 0 c" to close a panel in command mode.

- Implement "Palette" interface silmilar to UIMX (command /MOTIF/MULTI_PANEL).

- Provide a C callable interface for panels & palettes definition and display
instead of using the macro language (Jamie's request for Ged).

- Implement the possibility (user callable entries in C) to display a list and
return one selection in a user-defined command (action routine) - User
request -.

- new routine "interactive_help_motif" to display a Motif selection box
with all possible choices when typing "HELP" without any argument.

- add fallback for "fileScWindow.width" (default 80) for changing ratio
in the browser between the dir - and file - lists of objects (requested by
Sven for Geant demo with big fonts).

- Implement the possibility to have an "All Cycles" view option in the
browser on VMS (at the moment it is commented). Change  "XmNradioBehavior"
to FALSE (to make combination of several view options possible).

- Implement the possibility to specify "IconBoxTITLES" as a resource in
.Xdefaults, e.g. "Paw++*iconType: 4" - User request -.

- add resource "panelInteractive" (True by default, or False to inhibit
"close" panel, and supress possibility for panel editing) - User request -.

- Prevent the HELP window(s) to disappear under kxterm.

- Store the "Paw++ Locate" window (km_HigzOutput) into the list of possible
windows to be raised  - User request -.

- bug correction for empty strings inside command argument panels.
