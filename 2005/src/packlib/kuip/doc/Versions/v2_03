*CMZ :  2.03/15 01/10/93  16.26.50  by  Alfred Nathaniel
*-- Author :    Alfred Nathaniel   05/07/93
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/15   01/10/93 16.26.50
*
* Motif: provide dummy mbstowcs() for VAX/VMS.
*
* KXTERM: fix communication problem if output stream contains # character.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/14   29/09/93 15.50.24
*
* KXTERM: add display of current local directory.
* Line buffering between application process and kxterm
* because mailboxes use record I/O.
*
* MANUAL command: recursive descent to all submenus.
*
* EXEC command in Motif mode: allow to pass more than one macro argument.
*
* KIMATH: fix problem for "vec(1)<vec(2)".
* Round to 6 significat digits before testing equality/non-eq. of expressions.
*
* Unix and VMS: use unique names for all tempfiles.
*
* KUVAR: don't do alias translations etc.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/13   16/09/93 17.21.03
*
* KUIPC: fix for long names as >Action routines
*
* KUEDIT: test return code from system() == -1 rather than < 0
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/12   13/09/93 09.34.59
*
* KIMINT: don't interpret [] inside application text as variable names.
*
* KIMATH: Change in treatment of vector names to allow:
*   a = '?'
*   IF [a]='?' THEN
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/11   06/09/93 08.50.52
*
* $var now looks for environment variable on VMS as well.  Uppercase names are
* searched first in the logical names tables and then in the symbol table.
* Lowercase names are searched for only in the symbol table.  Replacement is
* suppressed if $var is followed by a colon to avoid DISK$USER: etc.
*
* New command SET/LCDIR to change current working directory (only for Unix
* and VMS).
*
* Asynchronous editing for VMS implemented (not yet fully tested).
* HOST_EDITOR must be TPU/DISPLAY=MOTIF.
*
* $VEXIST did not work if the vector has existing.  $QUOTE did not work
* correctly (reported by by Tim Adye).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/10   03/09/93 11.13.54
*
* Second iteration of KUIP/Motif for VMS.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/09   02/09/93 11.53.22
*
* Bug fix for $VLEN function.
*
* First iteration of kxterm for VMS (C.W. Hobbs/DEC).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/08   01/09/93 09.45.31
*
* Allow digits as first character in an alias name.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/07   31/08/93 18.14.00
*
* New routine KUFDEF to define application specific system functions.
*
* Buffer flushing for RS/6000 to keep correct sequence of C and Fortran output
* if stdout is redirected into a file.  This requires compiler version xlf 2.3.
*
* First iteration of Windows/NT port (Valeri Fine).
*
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/06   25/08/93 13.09.50
*
* Problems with +KEEP with PATCHY vs. CMZ installation.
*
* $OS and $MACHINE were not described in HELP FUNCTIONS
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/05   24/08/93 17.23.28
*
*
* KUIPC: part of the menu tree was forgotten in C output mode (reported by
* Robert Franchisseur).
*
* getline: mysterious hangups of Falco terminals connected to through a
* DECserver line to Ultrix (reported by Rob Kreuger).
* Went from POSIX terminal driver back to BSD driver for Ultrix.
* BSD driver (also used for Apollo and NeXT) now catches typeahead.
*
* KIMINT: bug in the handling of nested IFs:
*     IF 1=1 THEN
*        IF 1=1 THEN
*          IF 1=0 THEN
*             mess Not reached
*          ELSE
*             mess first
*          ENDIF
*        ENDIF
*        mess Okay
*        IF 1=1 THEN
*          IF 1=1 THEN
*             mess second
*          ENDIF
*        ENDIF
*     ENDIF
* did not execute any of the commands!  (Reported by Nige Watson.)
*
* KIMATH: Vector indizes can now contain expressions, e.g. VEC([n]+1)
*
* KUGETI/KUGETR: Arguments can be expressions which are evaluated.
*
* System functions can now be nested and the arguments can be expressions,
* e.g. "$lower($substring($OS$MACHINE,[k]+1,2*[n]))"
*
* New system functions: $INDEX(str1,str2), $WORDS(string,[sep]),
* $WORD(string,[k,[n,[sep]]]), $QUOTE(string), $UNQUOTE(string),
* $INLINE(string).
*
* ALIAS/CREATE: value is alias expanded; new option "-N" to inhibit expansion.
*
* ALIAS/LIST: print alias names sorted alphabetically.
*
* KIMINT: case labels were not properly recognized if the command following
* on the same line contained parenthethes.  (Reported by Mike Kelsey).
*
* KIMCAL: FOR statement crashed if the loop index had a name
* longer than 4 characters.  (Reported by Mike Kelsey).
*
* KIMCAL: SHIFT left a quote character at the end of [*].  (Reported by
* Mike Kelsey).
*
* The modifications for ;& and ;! introduced a bug:  single commands always
* returned status code 0.  As a result HELP went into the editor even if
* the command name was invalid.  (Reported by David Wagner).
*
* Final fix for old-style behaviour for optional parameters without defaults
* (mainly used by GEANT drawing commands).  (Thanks to Shaheen Tonse and
* Dean Chacon for pointing it out the actual problem.)
*
* KUVCRE actually imposed an upper limit of 10 characters for vector names.
* STYLE G did not write commands to LAST.KUMAC.
* TRACE ON WAIT did not allow to skip a command.
*
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/04   05/08/93 12.29.35
*
*
* new command "NEWPANEL" (defined in KUIPCDF) for building a new and
* empty panel to be filled interactively at run time.
* add possibility to raise (popup) the kxterm window.
* add a "LIST" button to all options parameters which gives access to a
* full explanation of the options.
* add "Exit" in the browser window (menu "File").
* update "helps" in KUIPMCDF.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/03   12/07/93 10.17.35
*
* Yacc grammar did not treat the cases of more than one string concatenation
* per expression and the comparison of a numeric value to a string.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/02   07/07/93 18.35.24
*
* Fix for KUIPC and YKUIP.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/01   06/07/93 10.02.10
*
* Fix for Alpha/OSF.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.03/00   05/07/93 17.35.42
*
* KIMATH:  the evaluation of
*    a = -2.34
*    b = 40
*    c = [a] - [b]
* resulted in c = -0.234E-39.  (Reported by Walter Brueckner).
* Expression evaluation is now done by a Yacc-generated parser which allows
* arbitrarily complex expressions like
*    c = [a]*[x] + [b]
* The IF statement can now also contain a combination of logical expressions
* like
*    if [a]<[b] .and. [c]>[d] then
*       ...
*    endif
*
*
* STYLE G:  clicking on the black box to select another option value could
* hand up the system in case one of the option values was the blank string.
* (Reported by Robert Franchisseur).
*
*
* KUIPC produced garbage Fortran code if the guidance text contained lots of
* significant blanks.  (Reported by Lawrence Williams).
*
* KUIPC in Fortran output mode did not handle correctly >Menu directives going
* upwards more than one level.  (Reported by Steve Fisher).
*
*
* KUOPEN:  added CALL DMCSCL... to avoid locking of VM-SFS files.
* (Request by Wojciech Wojcik).
*
* SHELL for Apollo:  memory was overwritten when the shell command exceeded
* 128 characters.  Also /bin/ksh was started as a restricted shell.
* (Reported by Nige Watson).
*
* GETLINE:  add support for DEC function keys F12/F13/F14.
* (Request by Jim Conboy).
*
* A command list separated by semicolon was not quite equivalent to the same
* commands on consecutive lines:  In
*    CMD1 ; CMD2
* the second command was not executed if the first one returned a non-zero
* status code.  CMD2 is now executed even if CMD1 fails.  The construct
*    CMD1 ;& CMD2
* allows to execute CMD2 only if CMD1 succeeds while
*    CMD1 ;! CMD2
* executes CMD2 only if CMD1 fails.  (Request by Burkhard Burow).
*
*
* Motif part: fixed some cases of NULL pointer dereferencing.
