*-- Author :    Alfred Nathaniel   25/02/93
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/07   930406 11.47
*
* Fix for KUGETx returning last value for optional parameters without default
* in case of positional arguments.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/06   930406  9.43
*
* "$name" will be replaced by value of environment variable if it is defined
* and "name" is not a KUIP system function.
*
* Allow switching to STYLE G from logon kumac.
*
* STYLE G: high-light last choice in menus; if panel is defined display it
* along with menus (reported by Robert Franchisseur).
*
* Increased limit for number of macro arguments from 9 to 99.
*
* IBM: disabled trapping of floating point underflows (CALL XUFLOW).
* Remove call to KUALFA from error handler.  This caused recursive Fortran I/O
* in the GKS version.
*
* DECstation c89: make it compile without "-common" option.
*
* Fixes for MSDOS version using f2c and gcc (Valery Fine).
*
* Set IQUEST(1)=0 before calling action routine to fix problem of VECTOR/READ
* with good filename being ignored after a VECTOR/READ with an invalid filename
* (reported by IVERSEN@VSFYS1.FI.UIB.NO)
*
* KUGETx returns last value for optional parameters without default value.
* Interactive Geant relies on this e.g. for the DRAW command.
*
* Version 2.01/02 introduced that all floating point numbers were printed with
* a decimal point.  This broke the usage of $SIGMA for index calculations.  The
* old behaviour that e.g. $SIGMA(2*3+1) returns "7" is restored.
* To solve the problem which originally triggered the change a new system
* function $RSIGMA is available now.  This function has be to used in COMIS
* calls expecting a REAL argument, e.g.
*    CALL file.f($RSIGMA(sqrt(x(1)))
* Otherwise the value may be passed as an INTEGER if the SIGMA result turns out
* to be a whole number.
*
* Filecase conversion for EXEC statements inside KUMACS.
*
* The invisible vector ? was not correctly treated for subranges (reported by
* Nicole Lhermitte).
*
* A continuation line start in the first column is concatenated as-is, e.g.
*    VEC/READ x,y,_
*    z,t file.dat
* is equivalent to "VEC/READ x,y,z,t file.dat".  Before there was put in at
* least one blanks between the concatenated lines.
*
* getline(): implemented ^J/LF (delete word), ^R (refresh) and ^X for style DCL
* and do output buffering.  Prefer Posix over BSD termio to solve problem with
* type-ahead on Sun.
*
* KUIP/SHELL for Apollo: use pgm_$invoke() instead of system().  Otherwise
* /com/sh is suspected to overwrite memory because of an unassigned I/O stream
* (reported by Robert Franchisseur).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/05   930311 12.35
*
* Fix problem if too many alias expansions happen during kumac compilation
* (reported by Hanspeter Beck).
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/04   930308 11.31
*
* Fix for help menu in browser.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/03   930305 15.12
*
* Renamed IGXMES to KMXMES.
*
* Motif version: enable help menus again.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/02   930302 18.12
*
* Bug fix for $SUBSTRING.
*
* VECTOR/INPUT: bug fix for 2-dim vectors
*
* VECTOR/PRINT: print proper indizes for 2-dim vectors
*
* First iteration for Alpha/OSF.
*
* KUIP/EDIT: default .KUMAC extension missing for MVS.
*
* Fix recursion if $LAST is used in a command (reported by B. BUROW).
*
* Emulate "%G" and "%.<n>d" format which behaves improperly on VAX/VMS.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/01   930226 17.22
*
* Small fix in KXTERM.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.01/00   930225 17.52
*
* KXUNIT: protection against very long filenames.
*
* A few more corrections for NeXT.
*
* KUIPC: allow call with input file name only.
*
* Ignore quotes around string in $SUBSTRING expression.
*
* Allow compilation with non-ANSI compiler.
*
* Non-folkloristic functions strdup(), strcasecmp(), etc. are only redefined
* if they do not exist in the C-library.
*
* New routine KUGETQ to protect arguments with multiple tokens by quotes.
* To be used by MACRO/EXEC that "EXEC macro 'Hello World'" is passed as
* one argument.
*
* More MVS/NEWLIB corrections.
*
* LAST command changed:  the new default N=-99 behaves like the old
* default N=-1.  Values -99<N<0 print out the last -N commands.
* This scheme originally invented for MVS support is also useful to
* allow cut-and-paste of blocks of commands on workstation screens.
