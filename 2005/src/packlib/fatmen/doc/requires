* Fatmen
*
*
* This directory was created from fatmen.car patch requires
 
The FATMEN package requires the following other packages to run:
 
- ZEBRA, KUIP, CSPACK (from CERN Program Library PACKLIB)
 
- KERNLIB
 
- FPACK (if the flag FPACK is +USEd)
 
In addition, the following system specific software is required:
 
VM/CMS systems
--------------
 
HEPVM software (EXECs, tape handling software, Tape Management System IF=TMS)
 
(An interface to VMTAPE and VMBATCH is also provided)
 
VAX/VMS systems
---------------
 
- VAXTAP (CERN Program Library) for tape handling
 
N.B. for server mode staging, a logical name STAGE_QUEUE must be
defined in the system table. This directory must be world writable.
The current recommended practice is:
 
a) Define STAGE_QUEUE to point to the same directory on all nodes
b) Use batch mode staging on all nodes.
   Batch mode staging is used by default if a batch queue STAGE_xxxxS
   exists, e.g. STAGE_8200S
 
Unix systems
------------
 
SHIFT/CORE software for tape handling, IF=SHIFT
 
L3 Apollo tape staging, IF=APOLLO and the file l3stage is found
in the current path.
