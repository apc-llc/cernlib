                Files stored in Lachman have a URL like:
                osm://[server-node:][/store-name][/storage-group]/bitfileID
                fatmen.storage-classes:
 
                   path storage-class [store-name] [storage-server]
                                      DELPHI       DELPHI-conservator@domain
                   osm://delphi-conservator@cern.ch/delphi/rawdata/bfid
