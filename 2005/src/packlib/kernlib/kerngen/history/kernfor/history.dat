              KERNLIB FORTRAN ROUTINES FOR ALL MACHINES

---------------------------------------------------------------------

              This file contains the following Patches


QM...     Machine type patches to select assembly options

TCGEN     all standard Fortran routines for KERNLIB,
          except the ones found on KERNNUM Pam

TCNUM     routines inherited from KERNNUM to make sure that
          GENSEC remains complete; this is not to be used for making
          a complete KERNLIB on machines where KERNNUM is ready;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The following Patch-names may be used with IF-parameters

The USE-selection of the machine-type is done on the
KERNLIB Pam-file of the particular machine;
the selection of the others is done by the machine-type patch
on the present Pam.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

KERNLIB routines in machine language or otherwise special
for individual machines are found on the following PAM-files:

      KERNALT    for  Alliant
      KERNAPO    for  APOLLO
      KERNCDC    for  CDC 7600 / 6000
      KERNCRY    for  CRAY RESEARCH INC.
      KERNCVX    for  Convex
      KERNDGE    for  DATA GENERAL
      KERNHPX    for  HP Unix
      KERNIBM    for  IBM 3090 with systems MVS or VM
      KERNIBX    for  IBM 3090 with system AIX
      KERNIRT    for  IBM / RT
      KERNNOR    for  NORD 500
      KERNOS9    for  Microware OS-9
      KERNPDP    for  DEC PDP 10
      KERNSGI    for  Silicon Graphics
      KERNSUN    for  SUN
      KERNTMO    for  Transputer with Meiko compiler
      KERNUNI    for  UNIVAC 1100 SERIES
      KERNVAX    for  Digital VAX 11
      KERNVMI    for  Digital VAX with MIPS processor
      KERNDOS    for  MSDOS and Windows/NT

These contain also the deletes of the unwanted Fortran routines,
and hence must pass trough YPATCHY just before the present Pam.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

A program to test a large number of the KERNLIB routines is
found on a separate Pam-file :

      MICKY      test program, verify expected results
