ASSEMBLER ROUTINES FOR UNIVAC 1100
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
THIS FILE CONTAINS TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF ROUTINES,CALLED GUNI AND GUY.
'GUNI' ARE THE ROUTINES WHICH HAVE BEEN ON THE GENSEC PAM-FILE FOR
SOME TIME, EXCEPT SOME BIT-HANDLING ROUTINES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADAPTED
FROM THE ORSAY LIBRARY. THEY WORK ONLY WITH THE OLD 11A COMPILER.
 
'GUY' ARE THE ROUTINES FROM THE ORSAY LIBRARY, RECEIVED SEPT. 1976.
THEY WORK WITH THE NEW FTN COMPILER WITH THE O-OPTION, BUT ALSO
WITH THE OLD COMPILERS.
 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GUNI :    FOR USE WITH PROGRAMS COMPILED BY THE FORTRAN 'E' COMPILER
          STRAIGHT-FORWARD ROUTINES, MAINLY FROM COPENHAGEN
 
          PILOT:    *GUNI
 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
GUY :     FOR USE WITH PROGRAMS COMPILED BY FORTRAN 'E', 'T' OR 'FTN' COMPILER
          ROUTINES FROM ORSAY/FRANCE
 
          PILOTS:   *GUYFORE  FOR FORTRAN V, VERSION 'E'  (=11A)
                    *GUYFORT  FOR FORTRAN V, VERSION 'T'  (=T2B)
                    *GUYFTN   FOR ASCII FORTRAN
 
 
          THESE ROUTINES REQUIRE THE PROCEDURE FORT$ DEFINED
          IN  P=GUYFORT$, D=FORT$,  SO YOU ALWAYS NEED:
 
               +ASM, 23, LUN=21, R=*   .@PDP,IL  FILE.*
               +EXE, GUYFORT$.
 
 
          MANY OF THESE ROUTINES CHECK ON THE PARAMETER VALUES AND
          BRANCH TO THE ENTRY POINT GERR$ FOR TROUBLE. YOU CAN
          LEAVE THIS AS AN UNSATISFIED EXTERNAL WHICH WILL NEVER BE
          NEEDED IF THE PROGRAM IS OK; YOU CAN  +USE, GUY GERR$.
          WHICH PROVIDES DIAGNOSTICS, OR YOU CAN WRITE YOUR OWN.
          LOOK OUT, GERR$ IS NOT REACHED BY 'CALL' BUT BY SLJ.
 
 
          OPTIONS:
          -------
 
          +USE, U1108.      FOR USE WITH 1106, 1108 MACHINES
          +USE, U1110.      FOR USE WITH 1110, 1100/XX MACHINES
 
          +USE, COMPATIBL.  ONLY FOR ORSAY-MODIFIED COMPILERS
 
 
          ONLY IF  *GUYFORT  IS SELECTED, ALSO:
 
          +USE, GUYOPTR.    HAS THE SAME MEANING AS OPTION R IN @FOR,R
                            = CALLS TO RMATH$ USE LMJ (DEFAULT IS LIJ)
                            AND UNIVAC-PROVIDED INTERCEPT ROUTINES
          +USE, GUYNNOP.    GENERATION OF A NOP INSTRUCTION ARGUMENT
                            LISTS.
          +USE, GUYDIAGP.   GENERATION OF DIAGNOSTIC PACKETS (FOR USE
                            WITH GERR$)
          +USE, GUYGERMAX.  EXTRA DIAGNOSTIC PACKETS, RELIES ON
                            ORSAY-MODIFIED FORTRAN LIBRARY.
 
 
          FOR CONTACT:    B. BOUQUET, LAB. ACC. LIN., UNIV. OF PARIS XI,
                                      F 91405 ORSAY

THIS FILE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PATCHES:
 
*GUNI     PILOT SELECTING 'GUNI' GENSEC
 
*GUYFORE  PILOT SELECTING 'GUY' GENSEC FOR VERSION 'E' OF FORTRAN V COMPILER
 
*GUYFORT  PILOT SELECTING 'GUY' GENSEC FOR VERSION 'T' OF FORTRAN V COMPILER
 
*GUYFTN   PILOT SELECTING 'GUY' GENSEC FOR ASCII FORTRAN COMPILER
 
GUYFORT$  DEFINITION OF THE PROCEDURE FORT$ FOR GUY
 
XVECTUNI  UNIVAC VERSIONS OF XIN ROUTINES
 
GUNI      ALL 'GUNI' ROUTINES
 
GUY       ESSENTIAL 'GUY' ROUTINES:
               1) NO FORTRAN VERSION EXISTING
               2) FREQUENTLY USED ROUTINE, PRESUMABLY MUCH FASTER
                  THAN THE FORTRAN VERSION IN P=TCGEN
 
GUYF      FURTHER 'GUY' ROUTINES, FOR WHICH THE FORTRAN VERSION
          MAY WELL BE JUST AS GOOD. IF YOU ARE COURAGEOUS, YOU TRY
          TO GET THEM OPERATIONAL; BUT BEFORE USING THEM YOU MUST BE
          QUITE SURE THEY WORK PERFECTLY.
 
GUYSYS    SPECIAL 'GUY' ROUTINES, NOT FORMALLY GENSEC
          HERE YOU CAN PICK INDIVIDUAL ROUTINES WHICH YOU NEED,
          BUT YOU MUST LOOK CAREFULLY AT LEAST AT THE COMMENTS
          IN THE CODE.
