*::>          VERSION  1.13/00   920303 14.00
*
*       First version of the $KUMACS PATCH.
*       Bug corrected in PAWFCU (A.Nathaniel)
*       Default values for X and Y in command TICKS are changed
*          to 1.E30.
*
*       Bug corrected in PAWFCU (bug submitted by W.Mueller GSI)
*       Description : If one wants to fill with NTUPLE/PROJECT a
*                     histogram with both  a cut C and a weight W
*                     one can use a command like
*                        NTU/PROJ 10 100.exp W*(C)
*                 e.g.   NTU/PROJ 10 100.x   a*(y>0)
*              which will increment at x with weight a if y>0.
*              This works fine, but the very similar case with two
*              conditions
*                        NTU/PROJ 10 100.exp W*(C1)*(C2)
*              never increments the histogram no matter what the
*              conditions are. (bug corrected by Andy Cox)
*
*       Many new routines added in PAWCS
*         (Most of the HBOOK user callable routines)
*
*       IGTERM is called in the PAWEX macros.
*
*       Mod in PAHIST to take care of the option "3" and "4" in the
*          command SURFACE
*
*       New routines PANT3D, PANTAX and PANTPM to plot Ntuple in 3D
*       (G.Richards)
*       In the comand CUTS, the parameter CHOPT is now called OPTION
