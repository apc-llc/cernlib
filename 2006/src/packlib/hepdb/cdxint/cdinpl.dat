>Guidance
Display help information of a given directory from data base. This
command will show the tree of directory on the screen. The user is
supposed to pick the directory for whose the help information is
required by positioning the cursor on the appropriate box and then
pressing the left mouse button (on Apollo) or space bar on a standard
terminal. The help information if avialable will be put into a file
and displayed to the user through the standard editor.

>Guidance
Plot data element(s) versus a key element for a given directory.
CHOPT guides the selection of data objects in a directory, as well as
the mode of display of the data objects.
 CHOPT = 'P'  a symbol to be drawn at each point
              (Default is a line to be drawn through the points)
       = 'L'  a line to be drawn through the points
              (needed only when symbol and line both to be drawn)
       = 'S'  all elements shown on the same plot
              (Default is a seperate plot for each variable)
       = 'X'  assumes validity range packed ala CDPKTS
The list of key and object elements to be plotted and the specification
of the selection on key values can be supplied through prompts or by
an auxiliary file.

>Guidance
Plot the time evolution of a given data element from a given directory.
The directory is addressed by its alias name and the data element is
addressed by a tag uniquely identifying the data element inside the
directory. CHOPT guides the selection of data objects in a directory,
as well as the mode of display of the data objects.
 CHOPT = 'P'  a symbol to be drawn at each point
              (Default is a line to be drawn through the points)
       = 'X'  assumes validity range packed ala CDPKTS
The specification of the selection on key values can be supplied through
prompts or by an auxiliary file.

Plot data element(s) versus data element(s) for a given directory.
CHOPT guides the selection of data objects in a directory, as well as
the mode of display of the data objects.
 CHOPT = 'L'  line to be drawn through the points
       = 'P'  a symbol to be drawn at each point
              (If L or P not chosen, a default marker to be drawn
               at each point)

The list of pair of object elements to be plotted and the specification
of the selection on key values can be supplied through prompts or by
an auxiliary file.

Plot validity time of data objects in a directory.
CHOPT guides the selection of data objects in a directory.
 CHOPT = 'X'  assumes validity range packed ala CDPKTS
Detail is given in the HEPDB documentation.
The specification of the selection on key values can be supplied through
prompts or by an auxiliary file.

>Guidance
Displays the directory structure of the RZ-file as specified by
the user through the Top directory name (by default it uses the
first data base file opened). The user can then pick the wanted
directory using the mouse button 1 by positioning on the last node.
Displays the User Keys in the directory specified on the screen,
in Horizontal or in Vertical mode. Displays data when the first
column in mode 'H' or 'D' in mode 'V' is overwritten by '*'
 CHOPT = 'H' : Displays data in horizontal mode
       = 'V' : Displays data in vertical mode
       = 'X' : Assumes validity range packed ala CDPKTS
>Action CDACPL

TOPN   'Top Directory name'                     C D='*'
>Guidance
Draw the tree of directories in the file given by the top directory
name.
