C.  Format for FZ output :
    --------------------
 
   HEPDB can create a journal file and can also update a data base from
the corresponding journal file. The journal file format is defined as an
FZ record consisting of a header and the data part. The format is
general enough and can also be used for the communication betwen the
server and a process which wants to update the data base.
 
   The data part of the FZ record is relevant for storage of data, help/
name information and also for creation of the directory. For storage of
data, the data part of the FZ record is exactly the same data structure
as input to CDSTOR. For efficiency reason, HEPDB for its own journal
file stores the data structure as input to the RZOUT call. This
difference can be easily recognised from the value of KEY(1), which is
zero for outside source and nonzero for HEPDB's own journal file.
 
   For creation of the directory, the data part consists of one bank
containing IPREC for the directory in the numeric user identifier and
the data word containing DELTA. For help/name information, the encoded
information packed into one ZEBRA bank is stored in the journal file
along with the header part with the directory/key information.
 
   The header part has very similar structure for the eight actions
foreseen so far, e.g., entering data, creating new directories, deleting
data objects, deleting a directory tree, renaming the keys, entering
names of data elements or help information for a directory, entering
alias name to a directory, deleting a few partitions in a partitioned
directory. However, they differ in details and the eight different types
of FZ headers are listed below.
