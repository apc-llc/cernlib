UMON commands
 
UMON commands allow you to communicate with your UMON monitor(s). You may
modify (the status of) your monitor(s) or handle the "log-sheets" produced
by these monitors. UMON commands can only be issued by the monitor's admini-
strator.
 
If you are not familiar with the concepts of UMON please read first the UMON
introduction (accessible via 'FIND UMON INTRODUCTION').
 
Note: All UMON commands are Special MeSsaGes to the service machine UMON.
      Therefore ALL these commands MUST BE PRECEDED BY 'CP SMSG UMON '.
      For READABILITY ONLY this "prefix" has been omitted in the text below.
 
 
 Monitor commands:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| QUERY  MONitor  moni   -->  shows attributes of monitor moni (Usage note 1) |
|                                                                             |
| MODIFY MONitor moni [admin|=]  [disk|=] [vaddr|=] [passw|=]   ( Usage     ) |
|                        --> gives (new) attributes to moni     (    note 2 ) |
|                                                                             |
| ACTIVATE MONitor moni  -->  monitor moni will accept to log messages        |
| BLOCK    MONitor moni  -->  monitor moni will refuse to log messages        |
| KILL     MONitor moni  -->  monitor moni ceases to exist                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
where:
 
 moni     is the name of the monitor
 admin    is the login-id of the person in charge of the monitor moni
 disk     is the logon-id to which the minidisk belongs
 vaddr    the disk's virtual address
 passw    the disk WRITE password
 =        used instead of a parameter means that the parameter will not change
 
 Log-sheet Commands:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| WRITEOUT LOGsheet moni  -->  empties the buffer onto disk    (Usage note 3) |
|                                                                             |
| SENDERASE LOGsheet moni -->  sends log-sheet to your reader and erases it   |
|                              immediately afterwards          (Usage Note 4) |
| SEND      LOGsheet moni -->  sends log-sheet to your reader  (Usage note 5) |
| ERASE     LOGsheet moni -->  erase the log-sheet                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
where:
 
 moni      is the name of the monitor used here as the filetype of the file
           onto which the monitor writes the log. The format of this file is:
 
             col       content
 
            1- 8   logon-id of the user who used the program
           10-15   date in the form dd mmm
           17-21   time in the form of hh:mm
 
 
Usage notes:
 
1. The meaning of the monitor attributes should be clear from the header in the
   response to your QUERY. The different forms of the monitor status 'blocked'
  'a-blocked,'s-blocked' and 'v-blocked') need some further explanations:
 
 status           meaning                           can be changed by
 
a-blocked     administrator-blocked, i.e.          the 'ACTIVATE' command
              blocked via the 'BLOCK' command
 
s-blocked     space-blocked, i.e. blocked by       freeing disk space by the
              UMON because the monitors disk      'SENDERASE' command, followed
              is full                              by 'ACTIVATE'
 
v-blocked     verification-blocked, i.e. blocked   correcting the attributes by
              by UMON because of wrong attributes  the 'MODIFY' command
              of the monitor
 
2. MODIFY MONITOR allows you to change all the attributes including the logon-
   id of the administrator. If you do this only the new administrator will be
   able to communicate with 'your' monitor.
 
3. For performance reasons logging is done in the memory of UMON. The buffer
   for each "log-sheet" is written on disk from time to time, at least once
   a day (around midnight). Use the WRITEOUT command BEFORE you reLINK to your
   monitor's disk if you want to have a look at the LATEST logs.
 
4. 'SENDERASE LOGSHEET' is the recommended way of dealing with the "log-sheets"
   in case
 
    - your disk is getting full and
    - you do not want to loose a single recording
 
5. Both 'SENDERASE' and 'SEND' imply 'WRITEOUT', i.e. you will get the latest
   version of the "log-sheet" into your reader.
