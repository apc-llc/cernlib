UMCOM is an usage monitor package for VAX/VMS systems. Usage log requests are
performed either via Fortran calls or via DCL commands.
Structure:      Complete program and subroutine package
_________
                User Entry Names: UMCOM, UMLOG
Usage:                 CALL UMCOM(CMD,MONITOR,TEXT)
_____
                CMD    A character variable constant or expression whose first
                       two letters are interpreted as a command to UMON. See
                       long write-up for possible commands.
                MONITOR  A character variable containing the name of the moni-
                       tor to be affected by the command. The maximum name
                       length for a monitor is 8 characters.
                TEXT   A character variable containing information related to
                       the command given. If string is longer than 80 charac-
                       ters it will be truncated.
                       CALL UMLOG(MONITOR,TEXT)
                MONITOR  Character containing the name of the monitor.  A moni-
                       tor can be eight characters long at most. If MONITOR is
                       longer than eight characters, only the first eight char-
                       acters will be considered.
                TEXT   Character string containing the text to be logged. If
                       TEXT is longer than 80 characters, only the first 80
                       characters will be used.
Method:         The long write-up should be consulted.
