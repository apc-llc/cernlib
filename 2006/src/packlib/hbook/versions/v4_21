*
*    Correct bug in HNTDEL (see after HDELET the 2 lines commented)
*

*
*    New routine HRENDC
*    C I/O option implemented in HRFILE/HROPEN
*

*
*    Maximum size of PAWCR4 increased from 5000 to 50000 words
*
*::>          VERSION  4.21/09   28/02/94 18.55.39
*
*    Option 'W' can be specified with option 'L' (log likelihood)
*     When option W is given, bins with errors=0 are not used in the fit.
*
*    New option 'Z' added in HFITV.
*    When option 'Z' is given, UFCN is the user fitting model
*    UFCN is a subroutine with the calling sequence:
*       Subroutine UFCN(N,X,Y,EY,NPAR,IFLAG,NPFITS)
*     where X(N),Y(N),EY(N) are the input vectors,
*           NPAR the number of parameters
*           NPFITS is an output parameter= Number of points used in the fit
*     The user must declare the common/HCFITD/FITPAD(24),FITFUN in UFCN
*
*    Change name of routine HBIBNIT to HBINIT1 to avoid clash with OPAL.
*
*    New routine HKIND returning the type of ID.
*
*    Bug corrected in HFITV: variable BINWID not set. (Reported by W.Mueller)
*
*    Argument missing in CALL MZPUSH in routine HRZKEY.
*

*
*    New routines HKFILL, HKF1, HKFF1, HKF2, HKFF2, HKFILPF,HKFI1,HKFFI1.
*    These routines are fast filling routines called in teh context of PAW	
*    by the new COMIS translator facility.
*
*    Packing of floating points in CWN was not correct.
*    Fixes are in routines HFNT2, HGNT2, HGNTF, HNTNAM.
*
*    Set IQUEST(1) in HRZIN/HRZOUT.
*
*    Clear buffers in HREND.
*
*    Changes in HCDIR/HLDIR and HLNEXT for PIAF files.
*
*    Changes in HROUT and HNTRD:
*     Status word should be 0 when buffer comes from disk. However, in one
*     strange case (when coming from Piaf) it was not 0.
*
*    New routine HF1E(id,x,w,e) to fill a 1-D histogram
*        ID contents incremented by W
*        ID errors incremented by E**2
*
*    New routine HBOOKNC. This new routine has a calling sequence
*    very close to HBOOKN and creates a CWN instead.
*
*    Changes in pilot patch for WINNT and MSDOS versions.
*
*    Don't reset LBUF and LTMP in HCDIR and HROUT. Only update the
*    master pointer LBUFM and LTMPM. Other routines involved: HNBUF,
*    HNBUFD, HNBUFR, HNTMP, HNTMPD. This fixed a bug reported
*    by M. Dahlinger.
*
*    New routine HNTDEL. This routine is called by HREND and deletes
*    all Ntuple headers of non-memory resident Ntuples related to the
*    closed unit from //PAWC.
*
*    In HRZCD used sequence $CZSOCK.
*
*    Compute binomial errors in HOPERA if option B is given.
*
*    New routines HBONT,HFONT,HFONTR,HFONTCX to create and fill
*       an Omnipurpose Column-Wise-ntuple.
*    NEW sequence /HCBONT/
*
*    Optimisation in HRZKEY
*
*    In HNTNAM a protection was missing

*
*    Bug found in the hmcstats code and fixed. The bug would have
*    caused slightly different results for people using VERY low monte carlo
*    statistics, with lots of empty bins (Christine Beeston).
*
*    New routines HLNXTG and HLNXTG1 in HGLOBAL.
*    New routines HLNXTM and HLNXTM1 in HMMAP.
*    New routines HRZING and HRZINM called from HLATTR.
*    These new routines are called by HLNEXT to return the next
*    object from a global section or shared memory.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.21/05   29/11/93 17.23.14

     HSTAF is automatically called by the HPLOT options 'HSTA' and 'HNST'
*
*::>          VERSION  4.21/03   25/11/93 15.47.53
*
*    New routine HRZKEY called by HRIN. The new routine may speed up
*    considerably the routines HGN and HGNF. It computes the serial key
*    number for each ntuple extension and stores it in a bank which
*    is the next of LCONT.
*    Routines HGN and HGNF modified accordingly.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.21/02   17/11/93 13.06.05

*
*    Implement possibility to add 1-D histograms with alphanumeric labels
*    Mods in HOPERA. New routine HOPER1A.
*
*    Protection in routine HDBCOP (R.J.Genik). See comments in routine.
