C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE IS A TRANSLATION OF THE ALGOL PROCEDURE
C     CBABK2, WHICH IS A COMPLEX VERSION OF BALBAK,
C     NUM. MATH. 13, 293-304(1969) BY PARLETT AND REINSCH.
C     HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 315-326(1971).
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE FORMS THE EIGENVECTORS OF A COMPLEX GENERAL
C     MATRIX BY BACK TRANSFORMING THOSE OF THE CORRESPONDING
C     BALANCED MATRIX DETERMINED BY  CBAL.
C
C     ON INPUT
C
C        NM MUST BE SET TO THE ROW DIMENSION OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL
C          ARRAY PARAMETERS AS DECLARED IN THE CALLING PROGRAM
C          DIMENSION STATEMENT.
C
C        N IS THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX.
C
C        LOW AND IGH ARE INTEGERS DETERMINED BY  CBAL.
C
C        SCALE CONTAINS INFORMATION DETERMINING THE PERMUTATIONS
C          AND SCALING FACTORS USED BY  CBAL.
C
C        M IS THE NUMBER OF EIGENVECTORS TO BE BACK TRANSFORMED.
C
C        ZR AND ZI CONTAIN THE REAL AND IMAGINARY PARTS,
C          RESPECTIVELY, OF THE EIGENVECTORS TO BE
C          BACK TRANSFORMED IN THEIR FIRST M COLUMNS.
C
C     ON OUTPUT
C
C        ZR AND ZI CONTAIN THE REAL AND IMAGINARY PARTS,
C          RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TRANSFORMED EIGENVECTORS
C          IN THEIR FIRST M COLUMNS.
