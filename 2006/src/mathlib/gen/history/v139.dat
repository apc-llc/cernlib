C
C  Global changes:
C
C  Introduce NOQUAD and QUAD flags
C
C  Assign 128 bits Functions value 0 when 'not available', to avoid warn.
C
C  Introduce IMP128 sequence and GAUSS128 into D103
C
C  Correct IMP64R sequence definition for the CRAY.
C
C  Replace FGEN patch by the new MACHINETYPE.
C
C  Define error code CODE.0 for non-available entries
C  Introduce F90 flag to mark f90-specific code
C  Change all instances of REAL*8 to DOUBLE PRECISION or REAL(2)
C  Introduce GCMPFUN sequence to represent generic functions of COMPLEX
C     argument in FORTRAN 77
C  Introduce DEF128 sequence to represent quadruple precision for the
C     systems where it is accepted.
C  Include GCMPLX definition to represent generic function for CMPLX or
C     DCPLX in GCMPFUN.
C  Make SAVE statements valid to all machines (V106, V108, V151)
C  Substitute definitions of GIMAG and GCMPLX in DECK,CELFUN64 (C320)
C     by a call to GCMPFUN and remove correspondingly GCMPLX and Z from
C     SEQ,DEFC64 inside the deck.
