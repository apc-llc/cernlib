*::>          VERSION  5.14/09   930222 13.40
*
*      Bug fixed in HPLWIR: The clipping was not reset.
*      The routine HPLAXI plot now only the axis for 2Dim plots
*         (the parameter ITYP is removed). It is also able
*         to use the alphanumeric labels of an histogram.
*      With OPTION ZFL1, the same picture name ('PICT00') is
*         used for every new picture.
*      It is now possible to specify with one SET command both
*         the border and the inside color for the Histogram, Box
*         Page, and Function (HCOL, BCOL, PCOL, FCOL).
*         Ex:
*                            +---- The Histogram is filled
*                            |+--- The border color is 2
*                            ||++- The inside color is 3
*                            ||||
*                            VVVV
*             PAW > SET HCOL 1203
*
*      Protection added in HPLF to prevent undefined value
*         returned by HQF.
*      FLOARG is now not used in HPLBOX.
*      Mods in HPLF. Case of predefine fits the "Too many channels"
*         error doesn't append.
*      Bug fixed in HPLSET: The variables I*BCOL was not initialized
*         correctly.
*      Improvment in HPLC. In case of LOGY with option SAME, the
*         mininum of the previously defined window is used if the
*         content of the histogram is less or equal to 0.

*         with a LOGY scale, some contribution was sometimes
*         added even if the bin content was null.
