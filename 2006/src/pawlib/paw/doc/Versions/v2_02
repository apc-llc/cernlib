*::>          VERSION  2.02/02   26/05/93 15.44.39
*
*
*      Sequence PAWBIG extended from 1000000 to 2000000 words
*
*      Changes in PAWCS (Logical units) for NEWLIB version
*
*      Several changes for the CHAIN mechanism.
*
*      Many changes for the PIAF server.
*      First PIAF client-server implementation
*      New PATCH, HBPIAF. This contains HBOOK routines modified for
*      the PIAF server.
*
*      New command NTUPLE/RECOVER to recover ntuple files with missing headers
*
*      Mods in PAWROP. An already open file in U mode cannot be attached
*      if another process is also attaching the file in U mode. RZEND now
*      called to delete the ZEBRA structure.
*
*      Changes in PCHNCD
*
*      New HIGZ routine IGTCCH called in PACSEL
*
*      Many changes in MOTIF version to support new coordinate systems
*      (Polar, cylindrical,spherical,pseudo-rapidity)
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/01   11/05/93 15.30.32
*
*      Routines PAWINTM and PAWINT merged into PAWINT. This implies changes
*      in 0PAMAIN and 0PAMAINM.
*
*      Changes calls to CSRPAW and CSRJCL to new COMIS routines
*        CSR1FN,CSR2FN and CSR3FN.
*
*      Sequences CZSOCK and CZBUFF transfered to HBOOK.
*      Implemented RPC for HRDIR.
*      Fortran/Close closes now also correctly file connected to piafserv.
*      Routine PSRZIN does not look in PAWC anymore (see comments in routine).
*
*      Bug fixed in PFINDV (IBM case) KLINE not cleared
*
*      Bug fixed in PBIN for integers
*
*      New sequence PACOMIS introduced. Space for COMIS increased from 10000
*      to 20000 words. PACOMIS referenced in PAWINT/PAWINTM
*
*      New menu PIAF introduced. See corresponding HELP.
*
*      Routines HGETID and HGETIR modified for the implementation of
*      the new sub-range facility.
*      Histogram subranges can be specified in 2 different ways:
*        1- h/pl id(ic1:ic2) with ic1 and ic2 integers means plot
*                            from channel ic1 to channel ic2
*        2- h/pl id(x1:x2) with x1 and x2 reals (with a .) means plot
*                            from channel corresponding to x1
*        Note that the mix mode h/pl id(x1:ic2) is also accepted
*        This subrange works also for 2-DIM cases.
*
*      Interface to new version of COMIS introduced.
*      Many bugs (COMIS) corrected (the complete list from W.Mueller)
*      KUIP vectors can be used in COMIS main programs.
*      Garbage collections do not destroy the KUIP vectors in COMIS routines.
*
*      In Histo/fit and Vector/Fit commands, one can now reference
*      an already compiled COMIS routine. The previous version accepted
*      only COMIS files.
*
*      Sequences HPL3 and HIMETA suppressed.
*      New option -P for CHAIN command.
*      Work dialog for NTUPLE commands looping over chains (PAW++ only)
*
*::>          VERSION  2.02/00   930429  8.26
*
*      Chain logic implemented. See HELP Ntuple/Chain.
*
*      Many changes due to the introduction of the PIAF server
*
*      bug fixed in PAWFCA. Local variable I1 changed to J1 to avoid
*      a possible overwrite of I1 in /HCBITS/
*
*      bug fixed in PAWFCU. Element 29 of array LNEXT set to 1.
*      This solves the problem :N/PLOT xxxx.XMNEN(VAR1,VAR2)
*
*      Changes to Graphical cuts.
*      Graphical cuts on tranformations of the original variables
*      are accepted. This new facility requires a new version of SIGMA.
*
*      In PAWCS INTRINSIC ERF,ERFC instead of EXTERNAL for IBM.
*
*      Mods in PAFORT for calls to COMIS on VAX
*
