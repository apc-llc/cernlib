C
C          22.08.89
C   1) Added routine CSEXPR(TEXTEXPR,JADDR)
C   2) Symbol _ can be used in names now
C   3) More correct treatments of tabs for VAX version
C   4) Small letters in character 'constant' now  avaliable
C   5) Some modifications are made for I/O codes
C
C          01.09.89  Removed bugs:
C   1) in REAL and INT intrinsic functions
C   2) x=-1. if(x.eq.-1)... now works correctly
C
C          11.09.89
C   Changes are made for i/o statements:
C   1) read ([unit=]lun, [fmt=]fmt [ [,err=lab] [,end=lab] [,iostat=iv] )ilist
C   2) write([unit=]lun, [fmt=]fmt [ [,err=lab] [,iostat=iv] )olist
C      fmt can be character constant: i.e. '(A)'
C   3) new descriptors are added to format: Tn,TLn,TRn,n(....),On,Zn
C      example: format(T2,4(O8,TR4,Z8,TL8,I8),:,I6//)
C      Now comis not support nP,S,SS,SP,BN,BZ format_descriptors only.
C
C          15.09.89
C    New facilites of i/o now are avaliable:
C    1) Unformatted sequential input/output
C    2) Unformatted direct access input/output
C    3) Formatted  direct access input/output
C            There are restrictions on unformatted i/o list:
C      a) read(lun) n,(buf(i),i=1,n)   is wrong and ,i am sorry,
C         this case not detected. Be carefully!!!
C      b) read(lun) string(2:i)   will cause wrong resault
C
C    File's name for IBM converts from " file.ext " to " /file ext "
C
C          17.09.89
C    1) The INQUIRE statement added to comis i/o statements:
C         INQUIRE(FILE=file,slist)
C       or
C         INQUIRE(UNIT=lun,slist)
C    2) Mods are made for the MPDSK and MDPAUS routines.
C         Now MDPAUS routine types prompt CONTINUE?(Y/N):
C         if reply was Y it try continue execution;
C         if reply was N then the STOP statement executed;
C         else repeats prompt.
C
C          20.09.89
C    A interface with kuip vectors is added to comis.
C    A statement:       VECTOR A(25,12,4),B(16),C(*),D
C    can be used in comis routines to declare kuip vectors,
C    if PAW version of comis was created.
C
C          22.09.89
C    The shift of kuip vectors during garbage now are taken into
C    account.
C    Quit statement, if it is first line, can be reduced to q.
C    LUNINP added to common /CSUNIT/LUNINP, .... for kuip macros
C    needs.
C
C         25.09.89
C   Up to 15 arguments now are avaliable for call f77 routines
C   from comis's level.
C
C         03.10.89
C   The cstran, csintx and csintz are splited into several routines.
C   The keywords PARAMETER and DIMENSION cannot be reduced  to
C   PAR and DIM.
C
C        04.10.89
C   Mods. are made in CSSINP routine like kupros.
C   MJSUBR routine replaced by JUMPAD from cernlib.
C   MJWORD routine replaced by LOCF   from cernlib.
C   CASETW routine replaced by VFILL  from cernlib.
C
C       12.10.89
C   Exit or Ex can be used with the same action as quit
C   Patchy flag DECS added for select Decstaton version
C   (for select this version UNIX flag also needed)
C    +patch,deccc. contents c-routines needed for comis.
C
C       08.11.89
C   Mods for SUN in CSCALI,etc.
C
C       12.04.90
C   Zero length character constant ( '' ) can used now.
C
C   Bug was fixed in the output statements ( print, write )
C   in a case then user calls from F77 level CS-routine
C   with constant arguments, for example:
C        CALL CSCALL( 'cstest',2,3,4)
C   and CS-routine defined as:
C        subroutine cstest(ia,ib)   print *,ia,ib   end  .
C   Now it works correctly.
C
C       27.04.90
C   1)  Complex data type are included in comis now.
C     The comis complex functions may be called from
C     f77 level in the following way:
C       cx=csccal('name',npar,p1,...,pn)
C   or
C       cx=cscjcl(jaddr, npar,p1,...,pn)
C   or
C       cx=cscfun(string ,p1,...,pn)
C   or
C       cx=cscjfn(jaddr,str1,p1,...,pn)
C  letter C must be used for complex parameter type description
C  Ex: string='cs_cx_fun(R,C)' to call cs_cx_fun with two arguments
C  of real and complex types.
C   2)  Almost full set of f77 intrinsic functions are implemented,
C       excepting CHAR, LLT, LLE, LGT, LGE
C
C       29.04.90
C       New comis directives are added:
C   !help   -- types list of the comis directives
C   !show   -- types help about show
C   !show   memory   -- shows comis memory state
C   !show   routines -- shows list of currently known routines
C   !show   commons  -- shows list of common/global blocks
C   !show   names common_name -- shows declarations of /common_name/
C   !remove cs_routine_name   -- removes cs_routine
C
C       06.05.90
C       New comis directive added:
C   !clear   -- clears comis intenal memory
C    The same action can be done by call from f77 level
C    routine CSDCLR.
C    The quit med_editor command cause skip source lines until eof.
C
C       08.06.90
C    MVS version introduced (from A.Michalon cradle)
C        Note that the IBMMVS version implies KUIP is used.
C
C       16.07.90
C    Bug corrected in CSKCAL for DECS version (A.Nathaniel)
C
C       18.07.90
C    Bugs corrected by V.Berezhnoi (.NOT. endh)
C
C
C       27.07.90
C    Parameter LCSTK changed from 333 to 1200 in common/CSCSTK/
C    to allow more than 19 continuation lines in routines
C    generated by the UWFUNC command of PAW.
C
C       16.07.91
C    Changes in CSIBMASS for XA mode (H.Butenschoen DESY)
C
