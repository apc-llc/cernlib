*-- Author :    Rene Brun   29/04/93
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/08   930624 12.35
*
*    A bug was fixed when parsing:
*       REAL SUB_NAME
*       ............
*       CALL SUB_NAME(ARG...)
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/07   930609 12.52
*
*
*    A bug was fixed in CSIODV routine, cause misprint
*    during added corrections for LINUX version.
*    A bug was fixed in parsing CHARACTER NAME*(IPAR)
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/06   930607 15.10
*
*
*     A character constant can lasts more then one line:
*       '  string
*    +     cont. string'
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/05   930603 19.08
*
*
*     New decks added CSCALIA,CSCALRA and CSCALDA with a flag ALPHA_OSF
*     MVBITS intrinsic routine added
*     Corrections for LINUX by V.Balashov
*     For MJCHARS and MJSUBRS decks the flag SUN changed to OLDVSUN.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/04   930527 12.00
*
*
*     Added intrinsic functions ISHFTC and IBITS
*     Added functions LOCF and LOCB
*     CHARACTER *(const_int_expr) is permit
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/03   930526 11.44
*
*
*     Added IMPLICIT NONE statement
*     New routine CSALLO,IF=UNIX.
*     This routine allocate a block of memory then /MDPOOL/ is full.
*       Correction for DESY
*        +SELF,IF=IBMMVS.
* +++          CALL KMVSSH(COMMAN)
* ---          CALL KXSHEL
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/02   930525  9.50
*
*
*     Changes in CSTRAN:
*        The sequence of ** operators is evaluted as in FORTRAN.
*
*        Under !FORTRAN directive a call statement like
*                 ENTRY X(Y)
*        will cause    ^ SYNTAX ERROR
*
*        The bug was fixed in parsing COMMONs statement, like
*            CHARACTER *12 TEXT1,TEXT2
*            COMMON/XXX/TEXT1,TEXT2
*           +      /ZZZ/I,J,K
*
*      Added INCLUDE statement
*
*        INCLUDE file  or INCLUDE 'file'
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/01   11/05/93 10.19.43
*
*      Changes in CSMKVD. Routine now called without arguments.
*
*      New routines CSR1FN, CSR2FN and CSR3FN. These routines are
*      faster than the general routine CSRJCL. CSR1FN is a replacement
*      for the obsolete routine CSRPAW.
*
*     1.  Vector statement can be used in more then one routine.
*     2.  Vector can be redefined in the main program.
*     3.  COMIS treatment correctly any ZEBRA bank movement.
*     4.  A list-directed WRITE statement generate multiple
*         records in the case when i/o list contains more items
*         than fit on a single line.
*     5.  A list-directed READ statement reads multiple records
*         in the same case as 4.
*     6.  Added intrinsic functions:
*           IOR IEOR IAND ISHFT BTEST IBSET IBCLS and NINT
*     7.  Inline comments with ! now possible
*
*::>          VERSION  1.14/00   930429  8.43
*
*      Extensions to CSEXT to specify the type of functions.
*      CALL CSEXT('MYFUNC.I,CHFUNC.C,RFUNC.R,...
*        declares MYFUNC to be an INTEGER Function
*                 CHFUNC to be a CHARACTER Function
*                 RFUNC to be a REAL Function
*        Recognised types are: I,R,C,L(logical), X(complex), S(Subroutine)
*        Note that the default type is S.
*
*      New routine CSTYPE(csaddr(name),chtype) to return the type of name
*       following the CSEXT convention.
*
*      At compilation time, the COMIS data stack is preset to 0
*
*      The COMIS_SCRATCH file is overwritten at every new compilation.
*      This avoids problems with PAW when users specify many times the
*      same COMIS file in ntuple expressions.
